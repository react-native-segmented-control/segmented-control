React Native SegmentedControl library. Use SegmentedControl to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

For Android and Web, it has a js implementation that mocks iOS 13 style of UISegmentedControl.

**For Expo Users:** Expo SDK 38 or later is required for this package.

## Supported React Native Version

| react-native-segmented-control | react-native |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| v2.2.0                         | >= 0.62      |
| <= v2.2.0                      | >= 0.57      |

This module is NOT supported in the Expo Go app on iOS, because it requires custom native code. You need to use a custom development client or eject into bare workflow in order to use this module on iOS.

## Getting started

Install the library using either Yarn:

```
yarn add @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
```

or npm:

```
npm install --save @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control
```

## Link

### React Native 0.60+

The package is [automatically linked](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) when building the app. All you need to do is:

```sh
npx pod-install
```

For android, no linking is needed, as the module is implemented in js.

<details>
   <summary>For React Native version 0.59 or older</summary>
### React Native <= 0.59

run `react-native link @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control`

or you can follow the instructions to [manually link this package](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking).

## Upgrading to React Native _0.60+_

New React Native comes with `autolinking` feature, which automatically links Native Modules in your project. In order to get it to work, make sure you unlink `Segmented Control` first:

`react-native unlink @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control`

</details>

## Migrating from the core `react-native` module

This module was created when the segmentedControlIos was split out from the core of React Native. To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import {SegmentedControlIOS} from 'react-native';
```

to:

```javascript
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control';
```

## Usage

Start by importing the library:

Use `SegmentedControl` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the
selectedIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable.
Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user
selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.

```javascript
import SegmentedControl from '@react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control';

return (
  <SegmentedControl
    values={['One', 'Two']}
    selectedIndex={this.state.selectedIndex}
    onChange={(event) => {
      this.setState({selectedIndex: event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex});
    }}
  />
);
```

## Tips and Tricks

### How can I increase the height of the tab ?

For android and IOS, simply pass `prop.style`:

```json
{
  "height": number
}
```

For react-native-web, additionally pass :

```json
{
  "paddingVertical": number,
  or
  "height": number
}
```

### Adding padding makes text disappear on Android

If padding amount exceeds the fixed height of the container, it will shrink the text. So either increase the height or reduce your padding.
